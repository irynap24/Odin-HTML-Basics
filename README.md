A simple HTML and CSS built static site, following guidelines of Odin Project.
Project is based on orchids, includes images and info cards about orchids.

Approach for the project:

1. Created a button with the class signup, which displays the text "Sign up".
2. Added an onClick event to the button, which triggers the changeHeadingText() function when clicked.
3. Created a function changeHeadingText() to update the text of a specific heading element (h2) with the class sign-up-heading when the button is clicked.
4. Using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, the function changeHeadingText() selects the heading by its class (sign-up-heading).
5. Updated the text of the heading to "Thanks for signing up" when the button is clicked.
